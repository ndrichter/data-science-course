# Deep Learning and Machine Learning
## What's the difference?
- Machine learning: subset of AI that uses computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it has learned, without being explicitly programmed
- Deep Learning: A specialized subset of machine learning that uses layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making
- Neural networks take inspiration from biological neural networks. Layered collection of computing nodes

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Neural networks been around for decades but computational power was too expensive enough back then
- Deep learning: "neural networks on steroids" :)
- Allows for multiple layers of neural networks, tens of thousands processing cores
- Can be used for speech recognition, images, people and learn on its own
- Based on matrices and linear algebra

## Applications of Machine Learning
- Classification, cluster analysis, market analysis, predictive analysis, fraud detection
- Packages like R allow you to not completely understand how to use the analysis methods, but need to understand interpreting results
- Netflix uses machine learning to recommend movies to you based on movies that you have already watched and liked or disliked

## Regression
- Statistical technique of regression models, its use is in all statistical analysis
- Story of earning masters with a thesis that concludes bigger houses are more expensive than smaller houses ("department of obvious conclusions")
- Real value added by the research rested in quantifying the magnitude of those relationships

## Summary
- The differences between some common Data Science terms, including Deep Learning and Machine Learning.
- Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning that simulates human decision-making using neural networks.
- Machine Learning has many applications, from recommender systems that provide relevant choices for customers on commercial websites, to detailed analysis of financial markets.
- How to use regression to analyze data.
