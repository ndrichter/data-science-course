# Big Data and Data Mining
## Foundations of Big Data
- Dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data being created by people, tools and machines
- V's of big data: velocity, volume, variety, veracity, value
- Velocity - speed the data accumulates
- Volume - scale of the data
- Variety - diversity of the data, in terms of structure and sources
- Veracity - quality and origin of data and its conformity to facts and accuracy
- Value - ability and need to turn data into value
- Alternative tools such as Hadoop are required to process and analyze big data

## What is Hadoop?
- Premise: split and distribute data across thousands of machines for processing, then reorganize and sort for returned results
- Google broke bottleneck and others followed, like Hadoop

## How big data is driving digital transformation
- Combo of data science and big data determining value and direction for organizations/industries
- Netflix - went from DVDs in mail to digital streaming
- NBA shifting to 3 point shooters
- Emerging chief data officer roles

## Data Science Skills and Big Data
- Unix/Linux, Python and Pandas, relational databases, big data, Jupyter Notebooks

## Data Scientists at New York University
- Everyone has at least a little computer programming background
- Started emerging in businesses around 2012
- Parents realizing education in this area is important

## Data Mining
- Establish goals first, need to consider cost/benefit tradeoff to determine goals and scope, desired level of accuracy
- Selecting data: type of data, size and frequency of collection have direct bearing on cost of data mining
- Preprocessing data: identifying irrelevant, missing and erroneous data
- Transforming data: determine appropriate format in which data is stored
- Storing data: stored in a format that makes it conducive for data mining. Important factors include read/write privileges, data safety and privacy
- Mining data: using data analysis methods after the data has been stored
- Evaluating mining results: formal evaluation of the results and shared with stakeholders. Iterative process based on feedback

- How Big Data is defined by the Vs: Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Value.
- How Hadoop and other tools, combined with distributed computing power,  are used to handle the demands of Big Data.  
- What skills are required to analyse Big Data. 
- About the process of Data Mining, and how it produces results.
