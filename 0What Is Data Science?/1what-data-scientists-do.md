# What Do Data Scientists Do?
## Old Problems, new problems, data science solutions
- Transportation: getting Uber drivers to passengers, traffic performance in Toronto
- Environment: lakes and when/where harmful bacteria blooms happen

## Data Science Topics and Algorithms
- Regression - think cab ride, base fare and time/distance fare
- Neural Networks
- Visualization with R

In any field, and data science is no different, a simple solution is always preferred over a complicated one, 
especially if the performance is comparable.

- Structured/unstructured data (think tabular / not tabular)

## Cloud for Data Science
- Able to bypass physical limitations of your own machines to store and process data
- Multiple entities able to work on same data
- Access to technologies, tools and libraries from anywhere

## What makes someone a data scientist?
- "I define data scientist as someone Who finds solutions to problems by analyzing big or small data using appropriate tools and then tells stories to communicate her findings to the relevant stakeholders."
- "As long as one has a curious mind, fluency in analytics, and the ability to communicate the findings, I consider the person a data scientist."
- Some people argue to confine the definition, such as must use machine learning, author argues it should be broad so not to exclude or discourage so many people
- Some also argue the size of the data also matters, or that specific tools/software should be used
- "The goal should be to define data science in a more exclusive, discipline- and platform- size-free context where data-centric problem solving and the ability to weave strong narratives take center Stage."
- Another key ingredient is curiosity, willing to spend significant time on hunches

## Summary
- The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.
- Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data. 
- Accessing algorithms, tools, and data through the Cloud enables Data Scientists to stay up-to-date and collaborate easily.
