# Languages of Data Science
## Course Introduction
- Overview of tasks and open source tools data scientists use
- Will require programming
- Automation tooling
- Visual programming
- Cloud computing for data science

## Languages of data science
- Python, R, SQL good to start with but many more available
- All sorts of roles: business analyst, database engineer, data analyst, data engineer, data scientist, software engineer, etc.
- Focus of course will be on top 3 languages mentioned above

## Introduction to Python
- Python most popular language for data science
- Clear readable syntax with less code, open source
- Adopted by large organizations
- General purpose language with large standard library: Pandas, NumPy, Pytorch, Tensorflow, etc.
- Active community, promotes diversity

## Introduction to R Language
- Free software
- Mostly used by statisticians, mathematicians, and data miners
- Array oriented syntax makes it easier to translate math to code
- Popular in academia
- Integrates well with other languages
- Common math operations work out of the box
- Active global communities

## Introduction to SQL
- Structured query language
- Non-procedurally language, focused on managing structured/relational data
- Developed at IBM, much older
- A must in data engineering
- Allows access to data directly

## Other Languages
- Scala, Java, C++, Julia, JS, PHP, Go, etc.
- Java huge adoption, general purpose OO language. Hadoop is a java built app
- Scala supports functional programming, runs on JVM. Apache Spark built in Scala. Designed to be faster than Hadoop
- C++ enables system programming, improved processing speed, broader control over application. TensorFlow, MongoDB, Caffe
- JavaScript and server side node.js. Tensorflow JS, R-js
- Julia for high performance numerical analysis, relatively new. JuliaDB
