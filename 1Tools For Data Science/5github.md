# GitHub - Getting Started
- Creating repo on Github website
- Edit file in repo with website
- Committing changes
- Creating new file with built in editor on website
- Uploading a file

## GitHub - working with branches
- branch is snapshot of your repo
- Main/master branch is official version of code
- Child branches create copy of Master
- Allows for simultaneous work on code
- Able to test changes in branch, then merge into Master with PR

Skipped most of the rest of the course since it was basic git knowledge.
