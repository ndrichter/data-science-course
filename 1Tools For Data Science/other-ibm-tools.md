## Other IBM Tools for Data Science
- Watson Knowledge Catalog
- Date Refinery
- SPSS tools
- Model deployment strategies
- Auto AI
- OpenScale

## IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog
- Data catalog that is integrated with an enterprise data governance platform
- Merges analytics capabilities of Watson Studio
- Protects data from misuse and enables the sharing of assets with automated, dynamic masking of sensitive data elements
- Interactively discover, cleanse, and prepare data with a builtin in data refinery
- Catalog metadata allows for organization, searching, and includes automated suggestions

## Data Refinery
- Simplifies cleansing and preparing of data
- UI provides conditional filters, string manipulation to help refinement
- Provides visualizations of work done
- Able to construct relational database operations (like joins)
- Can automate process to continue analysis with jobs

## SPSS Modeler Flows in Watson Studio
- Modeler flows include some data management capabilities, as well as tools for data preparation, visualization, and model building
- Drag and drop UI to build flow chart
- Contains different types of nodes
- Provides sample flows for new users
- Connecting new data sources to the model nugget, you can get predictions on new data
- Can view model evaluation, confusion matrix, information, feature importance
- Neural network visualization with a network diagram
- View decision tree models
    - decision tree models are popular because they have a special structure that makes it easy to explain predictions or extract decision rules
    
## IBM SPSS Modeler
- Includes data management capabilities and tools for data preparation, visualization, model building and deployment
- SPSS Modeler is a data mining and text analytics application
- Provides a workspace, nodes in different tabs have different shapes, with pentagons used for modeling nodes
- Comes with modeler examples (churn prediction)

## SPSS Statistics
- Used to build predictive models, perform statistical analysis of data, and conduct other analytical tasks
- Looks similar to a spreadsheet
- Able to import variety of data formats
- Can create custom validation rules on data
- Able to build models based on data
- Chart builder based on data
- SPSS has its own syntax which can be generated or written manually

## Model Deployment with Watson Machine Learning
- Open standards for model deployment are designed to support model exchange between a variety of proprietary and open source models
    - Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML). Based on XML. Can be generated by Watson Studio
    - Portable Format for Analytics (PFA). Based on JSON.
    - ONNX: open neural network exchange
    
- IBM Watson Machine learning
    - Deploy models built with Watson Studio, SPSS Modeler, many open source packages
    - Support for both PMML and ONNX
    - Batch or online scoring
    
## Auto AI in Watson Studio
- Help automate machine learning pipelines
    - data preparation
    - model development
    - feature engineering
    - hyper parameter optimization
  
- Provides GUI to create and deploy machine learning models with real time visualizations
- Can view pipeline leader board to see best results
    - These pipelines can then be saved as assets in Watson Studio
    
- Only supports classification and regression models at the moment

## IBM Watson OpenScale
- OpenScale features:
    - Fairness: detect and mitigate model bias
    - Explainability: audit and explain model decisions
    - Model monitoring: monitor performance, help find causes when drift is detected
    - Business impact: correlate model metrics and business KPIs to measure business impact
