# Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab
## Introduction to Jupyter Notebook
- Browser based app that allows sharing and running of docs, code, algorithms etc.
- Able to record data science experiments
- Able to generate outputs plots and tables, is shareable
- Supports many languages
- JupyterLab extends notebook functionality
    - Can be used in cloud
    - Anaconda popular distribution
    
## Getting started with Jupyter
- Will be using virtual environment to run Jupyter
- Demos a Hello World output within a cell
- Overview of functionality: manipulating and running cells, markdown and presenting, shutting down

## Jupyter Kernels
- Notebook kernel is a computational engine that executes the code contained in a Notebook file
- Jupyter kernels for multiple languages exist
- Kernels perform the computation and produces the results

## Jupyter Architecture
- Two process model with a kernel and a client
- Client is the interface, kernel executes and returns results to client

## Lab - Jupyter Notebook - The Basics
- Ran through some basic functionality
- Running simple code, creating markdown with headers and HTML
- How to save, download, rename, modify cells/kernels
