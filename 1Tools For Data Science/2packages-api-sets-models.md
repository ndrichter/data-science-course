# Packages, APIs, Data Sets and Models
## Libraries for Data Science
- Scientific computing libraries
    - Pandas, data structure and tools using a dataframe
    - NumPy, arrays and matrices
    
- Visualization libraries
    - Matplotlib, plots and graphs, most popular
    - Seaborn, based on above
    
- Machine learning and deep learning libraries
    - Scikit-learn: regression, classification
    - Keras: DL neural networks
    - TensorFlow
    - Pytorch
    
- Apache Spark encompasses a few of the libraries functions
- Scala-libraries: Vegas, Big DL
- R-Libraries: Ggplo2

## Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
- API allows you to communicate with other software components using inputs/outputs
- REST APIs, representational state transfer APIS. Communicate over web to interact with web services
    - Communicated through HTTP request/response. Response typically returned as JSON
    - Watson Speech to Text API is an example
    
## Data Sets - Powering Data Science
- Structured collection of data
- Tabular: rows and columns (CSV)
- Hierarchical or network: tree like structure, or graph
- Raw
- Ownership: private and open data
- Where to find open data
    - open data portals
    - Governmental orgs
    - Kaggle
    - Google data set search
    
- Community Data Licence Agreement
    - Linux foundation project
    - enable access sharing and use of data openly
    - CDLA sharing and permissive
    
## Sharing Enterprise Data - Data Asset eXchange
- IBM DAX
- Curated collection of data sets that covers wide range of domains
- Data science friendly licenses
- Tutorials via Jupyter notebooks

## Machine Learning Models
- Models identify patterns in the data (model training) to make predictions
- Three classes: supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement
- Supervised:
    - Most common. Data is labeled and model trained.
    - Regression: predict real numerical values
    - Classification: classify things into categories
    
- Unsupervised
    - Data is not labeled. Trained without external help
    - Clustering and anomaly detection
    
- Reinforcement
    - Similar to human learning process
    - eg robot learning to walk, chess
    
- Deep learning
    - Loosely emulate how human brain works
    - natural language processing, image/audio/video analysis
    - typically requires very lage data sets, compute intensive
    - Popular frameworks: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras
    - Popular model repos ("model zoo"):
        - ONNX
    
## The Model Asset Exchange
- Pre-trained models to reduce time for value
- MAX is free open source deep learning microservices, uses pre-trained models
- Model serving microservices expose standardized REST API endpoints
