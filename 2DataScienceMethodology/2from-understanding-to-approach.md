# From Understanding to Approach
## Data Understanding
- Data understanding encompasses all activities related to constructing the data set
- Looking at data quality (missing values, misleading values)
- Iterative process

## Data Preparation - Concepts
- Process of cleansing data
- Transforming data so it's easier to work with
- Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make the machine 
  learning algorithms work
  
- Most time-consuming phase of project

# From Modeling to Evaluation
## Modeling - Concepts
- Data Modelling focuses on developing models that are either descriptive or predictive
- Uses training / test sets to calibrate the model

## Evaluation
- Assess quality / accuracy of model, iterative process
- Two phases: Diagnostic measures, statistical significance
