# Introduction to CRISP-DM
- Cross Industry Process for Data Mining
- The CRISP-DM methodology is a process aimed at increasing the use of data mining over a wide variety of business 
  applications and industries. The intent is to take case specific scenarios and general behaviors to make them domain neutral.
  
1. Business Understanding
    - Where intention of project is outlined
    
2. Data Understanding
    - Data collected at this stage
    - Understanding of what the business wants and needs determines what data is collected
    
3. Data Preparation
    - Transforming collected data into useable subset
    
4. Modeling
    - Model data to give meaningful insights and knowledge
    
5. Evaluation
    - Testing the selected model
    
6. Deployment
    - Model is used on new data outside scope of current data set
    

- CRISP-DM is a highly flexible and cyclical model. Flexibility is required at each step along with communication 
  to keep the project on track. At any of the six stages, it may be necessary to revisit an earlier stage and make changes.
