# What is Machine Learning?
## Introduction
 - Helps with predictions, such as determining if cell is benign or malignant
 - Subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed
 - Examples:
   - TV/Movie recommendations
   - Bank loan approval
   - Segment customers
 - Major techniques
   - Regression/Estimation: predicting continuous values
   - Classification: predict item class/category
   - Clustering: Finding structure of data; summarization
   - Associations: associating frequent co-occurring items/events
   - Anomaly detection: discovering abnormal and unusual cases
   - Sequence mining: predicting next events; click-stream
   - Dimension reduction: reducing size of data
   - Recommendation systems: recommend items

## Python For Machine Learning
- Libraries
  - NumPy: work with n dimensional arrays
  - SciPy: numerical algorithms
  - Matplotlib: provide graphical plotting
  - Pandas: provide data structures
  - Scikit-learn
    - free software machine learning library
    - Classification, regression, and clustering algorithms
    - Works with numpy and scipy
    - Good documentation and easy to implement
    - Can be used for most of ML pipeline

## Supervised vs Unsupervised
- Supervised: teach the model, then with that knowledge it can predict unknown or future instances
- Teach model with labeled data
- Two types of supervised: classification and regression
  - Classification is the process of predicting discrete class labels or categories
  - Regression is the process of predicting continuous values
- Unsupervised: model works on its own to discover information (unlabeled data)
  - Different types: dimension reduction, density estimation, market basket analysis, clustering
- Clustering
  - Grouping of data points or objects that are somehow similar by:
    - Discovering structure
    - Summarization
    - Anomaly detection
