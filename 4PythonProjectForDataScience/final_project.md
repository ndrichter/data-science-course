# Final Project: Analyzing Stock Performance and Building a Dashboard
## Stock Shares
A company's stock share is a piece of the company; more precisely:

A stock (also known as equity) is a security that represents the ownership of a fraction of a corporation. This
entitles the owner of the stock to a proportion of the corporation's assets and profits equal to how much stock they 
own. Units of stock are called "shares."
