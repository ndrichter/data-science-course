# Week 3
## Conditions and Branching
- Comparison operators (==, !=, >, <)
- Branching (if statements, else, elif)
- Logic operators (not, or, and)

## Loops
- For loops, iterating through lists and tuples
    - enumerate function for indexes
    
- While loops, runs until condition is met

## Functions
- Callable blocks of code that can also take inputs
- Used for repeatable code
- Python has many built-in functions (len, sum)
    - sorted (new sorted list) vs sort (sorts existing list)
    
- Making functions
    - def with parameters, returning output (returns None if nothing specified), documentation string
    - multiple input parameters
    - * to collect multiple arguments
    - Global scope: available outside function
    - Local scope: only available within function
    
## Exception Handling
- Handle errors to prevent logic from crashing
- Try except statements
- try except else finally statements

## Objects and Classes
- Every object has
    - a type
    - internal data representation
    - set of procedures (methods) for interacting with object
    
- Creating your own class with data attributes and methods
    - use __init__ to initialize data
    
- Class methods
    - adding class functions to modify data
    
- use dir(object) to get list of attributes and methods
